## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Standard ECS Benchmark Results

Based on the [C# ECS Benchmark suite](https://github.com/Doraku/Ecs.CSharp.Benchmark):

| Test | Arch ECS | Purlieu ECS (Estimated) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------------|--------|
| CreateEntityWithOneComponent | 3,694.8 μs | ~3,200 μs | Our pooling should be faster |
| SystemWithOneComponent | 32-47 μs | ~25-30 μs | SIMD + cache optimization |
| SystemWithTwoComponents | ~45-60 μs | ~30-40 μs | Zero-allocation iteration |
| Memory Allocation | Standard | Minimal | ChunksStack() eliminates allocations |

### Purlieu-Specific Optimizations

**SIMD Performance** (estimated 2-4x improvement on compatible data):
```csharp
// Traditional scalar processing
for (int i = 0; i < positions.Length; i++) {
    positions[i].X += velocities[i].X;
    positions[i].Y += velocities[i].Y;
    positions[i].Z += velocities[i].Z;
}

// Our SIMD optimization
Vector<float> vx = new Vector<float>(velocityData, 0);
Vector<float> px = new Vector<float>(positionData, 0);
Vector<float> result = px + vx;
```

**Zero-Allocation Iteration**:
- Arch: Creates enumerator objects during foreach loops
- Purlieu: ChunksStack() uses stack allocation, zero heap allocation

## 🎯 API Comparison

### Entity Creation

**Arch ECS:**
```csharp
using var world = World.Create();
var entity = world.Create(new Position(0, 0), new Velocity(1, 1));
```

**Purlieu ECS:**
```csharp
using var world = new World();
var entity = world.CreateEntity();
world.AddComponent(entity, new Position(0, 0));
world.AddComponent(entity, new Velocity(1, 1));
```

### Query Processing

**Arch ECS:**
```csharp
var query = new QueryDescription().WithAll<Position, Velocity>();
world.Query(in query, (Entity entity, ref Position pos, ref Velocity vel) => {
    pos.X += vel.X;
    pos.Y += vel.Y;
});
```

**Purlieu ECS:**
```csharp
var query = world.Query().With<Position>().With<Velocity>();
foreach (var chunk in query.ChunksStack()) {
    var positions = chunk.GetSpan<Position>();
    var velocities = chunk.GetSpan<Velocity>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < positions.Length; i++) {
        positions[i].X += velocities[i].X;
        positions[i].Y += velocities[i].Y;
    }
}
```
