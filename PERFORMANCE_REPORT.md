### Memory Optimization Results

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Memory Allocation** | 718,112 bytes (200 ops) | 86,944 bytes (200 ops) | **88% reduction** |

- **Large Archetypes (>64 entities)**: Full cache-line + SIMD alignment for performance
- **Result**: Eliminates memory waste while preserving performance where it matters

### 2. Thread Safety Enhancements
- **ComponentRegistry**: Thread-safe with proper locking mechanisms
- **ArchetypeIndex**: ConcurrentDictionary for query cache management
- **World Events**: Concurrent event channels with reflection method caching
- **SystemScheduler**: Defensive null checks and robust dependency resolution

### 3. Performance Characteristics
- **Linear Scalability**: Consistent O(n) performance across entity counts
- **Low Variance**: Standard deviations <1% indicate stable performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Predictable allocation patterns suitable for real-time applications
